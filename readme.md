This is a very simple program that runs a raster of PNG images and reads out pixels which are non-white. Those are counted and passed to Jenks algo to determine if there are natural clusters. 

The whole idea is a very simple test to see if documents could be similar by just checking how many pixels are non white. Think of it as a visual checksum.
